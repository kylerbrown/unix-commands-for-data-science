# unix commands for data science cheat sheet

A list of useful unix commands for data science. Since unix has been designed from the beginning as an operating system for scientists working with data, this cheatsheet could probably just be called "unix commands".

Commands tested with GNU coreutils 8.21, Bash 4.3.11, feedgnuplot 1.32, gnuplot 4.6.

This cheat sheet assumes data are comma separated, for other delimiters make the following adjustment:

    cut -d "DELIM"
    paste -d "DELIM"
    join -d "DELIM"
    sort -t "DELIM"
    awk -F "DELIM"
Pull requests/issues welcome.
